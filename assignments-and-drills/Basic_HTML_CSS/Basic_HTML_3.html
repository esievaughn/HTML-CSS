			<p>Unlike other species of birds where males and females express different colors,<br>
				male and female <span style="color:Navy; font-weight:bold;">Blue Jays</span> look alike.This is called <em>sexual monomorphism</em>.<br> 
				<span style="color:Navy; font-weight:bold">Blue Jays</span> are apart of the Corvidae family of birds(including crows, ravens, and magpies),<br>
				and are considered especially intelligent with tool making capabilities and curiosity.</P>
