		<h3>Bicycle Day</h3>
		<p>Bicycle Day is celebrated on April, 19th, every year commemorating Swiss chemist Albert Hofamnn's bicycle trip home on LSD.
		Hofmann created LSD in hopes of treating heart and lung issues unaware of its psychedelic properties. 
		Though Hofmann had no intentions that LSD would be used recreationally, professors and university students in the 80's 
		began celebrating April, 19th, as a psychedlic holiday. Over the years it has coincided with appreciation for utilizing
		bikes as alternative transportation, and April 19th, is also a day where people are encouraged to bike to work or 
		other activities.</p>
